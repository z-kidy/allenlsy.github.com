	The child without a name 无名小卒
	grew up to be the hand 登万乘之尊
	To watch you, to shield you, 为守你护你
	or kill on demand 甚至毁灭在所不惜
	The choice he made 所作所为
	he could not comprehend 他仍未清醒意识到
	He’s got a grim secret 绝无余地 冥冥注定
	they had to command 王，便是他的宿命
	
	He’s torn between his honor 他的一生在苍生膜拜的荣耀
	and the true love of his life 在生世真爱之间反复挣扎冲突
	He prayed for both but was denied 祈求两全但注定无望
	
	So many dreams are broken 几多梦想支离破碎
	and so much we sacrifice 几许牺牲无怨无悔
	Was it worth the ones we loved 所热爱的一切，值得与否?
	and had to leave behind 然总须弃诸身后
	So many years have past 流年似水
	toward a noble land of lies 谎言为基筑就荣耀之邦
	Will all our sins be justified? 一切原罪，将成明证的真理？
	
	The curse of his powers tormented his life 拥诅咒之力，致痛苦如附骨之蛆
	Obeying the crown was a sinister crime 君临天下却是滔天罪恶
	His soul was tortured by love and by pain 恩怨爱恨交织把灵魂扭曲
	He surely would flee but the oath made him stay 拼命逃离然宿命的诅咒如影随形
	
	Please forgive me for the sorrow 宽恕吧，纵是予你满腹哀伤
	For leaving you in fear 弃你而去，遗你于满怀恐惧
	For the dreams we had to silence 因这是为梦而必须学会的接受的隐忍
	That’s all there’ll ever be 此即任何时候任何事实不变的样子
	Still I’ll be the hand that saves you 我必仍是保全你救赎你的大能之手
	Though you’ll not see that it is me 勿庸置疑 即使永无人提起
