### [Simple & Clean](/ultimate-workspace-simple-clean)

Suitable for people who like clean desk. Made for simplicity, and cost saving. Geeks are also welcome to have a look.

### [Professional Geeks](/ultimate-workspace-professional-geeks)

For programmers and designers. Lots of Apple stuffs, multiple monitors, great gadgets (aimchair, keyboard, speaker...)

### [Home Office](/ultimate-workspace-home-office)

Great for a couple, to work together. And for a team who rent a whole house. 

### [Luxury Home](/ultimate-workspace-luxury)

Big house, with great window view. Wood desk in the room. Very costly home. I envy them.
