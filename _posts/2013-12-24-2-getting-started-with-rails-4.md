I recommend a video course on [Ruby language](https://tutsplus.com/course/the-fundamentals-of-ruby/) if you are interested in Ruby Language.

#### In this episode, we discussed...

* Rails project structure
* Start coding a Rails project
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem
* `rails`, `rake`, `bundle` command
* Database migration

__I have committed the project to Github__, [click to see the repository](https://github.com/allenlsy/sharebook). Use `git checkout ep02` to read the finished code of this episode.
